## Research Question

Can a tiny masked language model recover a planted conserved motif from synthetic protein-like sequences?

## Results — The Fidelity Ladder (iterations 01–09)

The full SMAIRT fidelity ladder was climbed end to end, from a hand-built nano-MLM
on planted data to a frozen 8M-parameter ESM-2 on real UniProt sequences. The same
evaluation methodology (mean-pool → linear-probe AUC → PCA, with explicit controls)
runs throughout.

| Iter | Script | Claim tested | Verdict |
|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 01 | `script_01_validate_generator` | generator plants the motif & masking is correct | PASS — baseline to beat 0.1076 |
| 02 | `script_02_train_nano_mlm` | nano-MLM beats baseline & rebuilds motif | PARTIAL — motif→1.0; metric flaw surfaced |
| 03 | `script_03_discriminating_motif` | multi-residue motif + dual baselines | PASS — 0.160 vs 0.084, hits ceiling |
| 04 | `script_04_conservation_sweep` | accuracy tracks conservation `p` | PASS — hugs Bayes-optimal `p+(1-p)/20` |
| 05 | `script_05_two_family_embeddings` | embeddings separate two families (by position) | PARTIAL — position is "free"; control flaw exposed |
| 06 | `script_06_covariation_families` | separate by single pairwise coupling | PARTIAL — controls fixed; signal too sparse |
| 07 | `script_07_bijection_coupling` | K=10 permutation coupling | PARTIAL — model > controls but rule too hard |
| 08 | `script_08_identity_coupling` | K=10 identity-copy coupling | **PASS — AUC 1.000, controls at chance, rule learned** |
| 09 | `script_09_esm2_family_separation` | frozen ESM-2 separates two **real** families | **PASS — AUC 1.000, silhouette 0.392, controls behave** |

**Rung 1** (01–04): the nano-MLM learns the planted grammar — beats the unigram
baseline, reconstructs the conserved motif near 1.0, and tracks the Bayes-optimal
conservation curve. **Rung 2** (05–08): a single model learns multi-position
structure and its embeddings separate two planted families by *learned* grammar,
proven confound-free (composition + untrained-model controls at chance). **Rung 3**
(09): a frozen pretrained ESM-2 (`esm2_t6_8M`, embeddings only, no fine-tuning)
separates real globins from cytochromes (shuffled-label and length controls confirm
real signal) — transfer from a real PLM.

Five of the nine iterations were PARTIAL; each refined the design and produced a
reusable anti-pattern in [`prompts/KNOWN_PATTERNS.md`](prompts/KNOWN_PATTERNS.md)
(§2.1–2.5). The honest PARTIAL→fix arc (especially 05→06→07→08) is the scientific
core of the project, not just the final PASSes.

## About This Project

This project uses the **SMAIRT** (Scientific Method with AI Research Template) framework.

### Core Philosophy

AI excels at regression toward the mean—it can get you quickly to the frontier of what's already known. The human contribution remains essential for:
- Making innovative connections
- Identifying truly novel questions
- Recognizing where AI suggestions fall short

### The Loop

```
Background → Hypothesis → Methods/Code → Results → Analysis → Next Steps → (repeat)
```

### The 4-Part Structure

The template records **4 pieces of information in separate files**:

1. **Background** - The question that went into prompting it, what has been done on that area, what's known about that question from the literature, and a summary of the previous results that have come up to this point
2. **Hypothesis** - Documented in `hypotheses/` using `HYPOTHESIS_TEMPLATE.md`
3. **Methods** - The actual code and data required to test the hypothesis
4. **Results + Interpretation** - Output logs (auto-captured by TeeLogger to `results/logs/`) plus analysis through the lens of the hypothesis

The **next steps** from your analysis feed right back into the background for the next iteration.

### Data Progression

1. **Synthetic data** (`experiments/01_synthetic/`) - Fast iteration, no dependencies
2. **Downloaded data** (`experiments/02_downloaded/`) - Benchmark datasets for validation
3. **Real data** (`experiments/03_real_data/`) - Your actual target data

4. Set up your AI session: `prompts/00_priming_prompts.md`
5. Start experimenting: `experiments/01_synthetic/`
6. Track your contributions: `prompts/intellectual_contribution.md`

## Key Conventions

### Script Naming
```
script_01_description.py
script_02_another_test.py
script_03_noise_robustness.py
```

### The Audit Trail

Every experiment connects through the audit trail:
```
hypotheses/H1_*.md → experiments/script_XX_*.py → results/logs/script_XX_*.log → analysis/
```

TeeLogger automatically captures all script output to `results/logs/`, creating the permanent record without manual copy-paste.

### Known Patterns & Error Prevention

Track reusable patterns and recurring errors in `prompts/KNOWN_PATTERNS.md`. This prevents repeating the same mistakes and preserves working solutions across sessions.

### Feeding Back to AI

For **IDE-native** workflows (Roo/Zoo, Cursor, Windsurf): AI reads project files directly—use `prompts/AI_CONTEXT.md` and `prompts/KNOWN_PATTERNS.md` as context.

For **browser-paste** workflows (ChatGPT, Claude web): Use `scripts/compile_for_ai.py` to generate a summary of the entire project state that you can paste into a new session.

## Parallel Story Generation

As a parallel output to the 4-part structure:
- A **paragraph** for each section
- A **figure** for the results section
- A **schematic diagram** for the methods showing the workflow

The final scientific product won't have all experiments together—it will be based on selected results. Use `paper_draft/` to build this narrative alongside your experiments.

---

## Caveats

- **Literature limitations:** LLMs can't do a deep dive on the literature. Be suspicious about what they bring from the literature—verify important claims independently.
- **Regression toward the mean:** AI is good at known approaches but less good at truly innovative connections. That's your job.
