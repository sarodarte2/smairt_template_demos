## 1. Executive Summary

This research project developed and validated a deterministic in-silico tryptic peptide digestion workflow. The study began with exact implementation of canonical trypsin cleavage rules, expanded to missed-cleavage enumeration, and then incorporated monoisotopic peptide mass calculations and mass-spectrometry observability filtering.

All three completed iterations support the core research objective. The canonical digest algorithm exactly matched hand-curated cases, missed-cleavage expansion followed the predicted combinatorial structure, and physical filtering showed that many raw tryptic fragments are not instrument-observable unless missed cleavages rescue short segments into the 500-5000 Da and 6-40 residue windows.

The final result is a reproducible peptide-library generation pipeline suitable for controlled proteomics analyses, with clearly stated boundaries around idealized chemistry, static monoisotopic masses, and omitted post-translational modifications.

## 2. Project Question and Study Scope

### Central Question

What tryptic peptides does a protein sequence produce, and which of those peptides are observable under standard mass-spectrometry constraints?

### Study Scope

This report covers the completed synthetic and rule-based validation phase: canonical digestion, missed-cleavage enumeration, monoisotopic mass calculation, and observable-window filtering.

### Model, Data, or Experimental Context

The workflow models standard trypsin cleavage after lysine or arginine, except when followed by proline. It uses deterministic peptide enumeration, ideal monoisotopic amino-acid residue masses, and standard MS-observable filters of 500-5000 Da and 6-40 residues. The final validation uses mature Bovine Serum Albumin as a realistic target protein.

### What This Study Does Not Resolve

The current implementation does not model post-translational modifications, isotope envelopes, charge-state distributions, enzymatic kinetics, digestion efficiency variation, chromatographic retention, or instrument-specific detectability.

| Result Area | Best or Representative Case | Main Quantitative Outcome | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Canonical trypsin rules | 5 hand-curated sequences | 100% exact-match validation; 0% proline-block violations | The core cleavage logic is correct. |

## 5. Iteration-Level Findings

### Iteration 01 — Canonical Trypsin Digestion

The first iteration validated the fundamental cleavage rule. Five hand-curated cases passed exactly, including explicit tests for the proline exception at K-P and R-P junctions. This established that the sequence parser and terminal fragment emission logic were reliable.

### Iteration 02 — Missed-Cleavage Expansion

The second iteration generalized the digester to support maximum missed cleavages N=0, 1, and 2. The peptide count expansion matched the expected adjacent-segment combinatorics, and average peptide length increased monotonically as N increased.

### Iteration 03 — Mass Calculation and Observability Filtering

The third iteration added monoisotopic peptide mass calculation and MS-observable filters. Reference peptide masses matched physical targets within approximately 0.001 Da. On BSA, many fully cleaved short fragments were filtered out, while N=1 and N=2 missed-cleavage libraries produced substantially more observable candidates.

---

## 6. Key Scientific Conclusions

1. Canonical trypsin cleavage can be implemented exactly as a deterministic sequence rule.
2. Missed-cleavage libraries expand peptide candidates in predictable bounded patterns.
3. Physical MS constraints exclude many fully cleaved short peptides.
4. Missed cleavages are not merely nuisance products; they can increase the observable peptide search space.
5. Ideal monoisotopic mass filtering is a useful foundation but must be extended for modifications, isotope envelopes, and instrument-specific behavior before experimental deployment.

## 8. Limitations and Caveats

1. Masses are ideal monoisotopic values and do not include modifications or adducts.
2. Observability is approximated by mass and length windows only.
3. Digestion is rule-based and does not model enzymatic cleavage probabilities.
4. No experimental spectra or peptide-spectrum matching is included.

---

## 9. Recommended Next Steps

1. Add common modifications such as carbamidomethylation and oxidation.
2. Add charge-state and isotope-envelope modeling.
3. Compare predicted peptides to a published BSA digest or other benchmark LC-MS/MS dataset.
4. Extend output formats for downstream search-engine libraries.

## 10. Final Assessment

### Primary Findings

- The canonical tryptic digest engine is correct on hand-verified cases.
- Missed-cleavage expansion behaves exactly as predicted.
- MS-observable peptide fractions depend strongly on missed-cleavage allowance.

### Research Significance

The study establishes a reproducible computational foundation for peptide-library generation and demonstrates why physical instrument constraints must be considered alongside enzymatic cleavage rules.

### Methodological Assessment

The research progression separated algorithmic correctness from physical observability. Each iteration tested one additional layer of realism, producing a clear and defensible chain from deterministic cleavage to instrument-filtered peptide candidates.
