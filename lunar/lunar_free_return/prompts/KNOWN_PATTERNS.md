# Known Patterns & Common Errors

## Purpose

This file is a **living reference** that records:
1. **Reusable code patterns** — Copy-pasteable implementations that work reliably
2. **Recurring errors** — Mistakes that have been made, their impact, and how to fix/prevent them
3. **Standards** — Canonical ways to perform common operations
4. **Pre-flight checklist** — Verification steps before submitting any new analysis

**Give this file to your AI at the start of every session** alongside `AI_CONTEXT.md` and `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`. This prevents repeating solved problems and ensures consistency across iterations.

## How to Use This File

1. **At session start**: Feed this to your AI so it doesn't repeat past mistakes
2. **Before writing code**: Check standards and patterns for the operation you're implementing
3. **Before submitting analysis**: Run through the pre-flight checklist
4. **After each iteration**: If you encountered an error or wrote reusable code, add it here
5. **When switching contexts**: API keys, paths, environment quirks go here

## 2. Recurring Errors & Anti-Patterns

Each entry documents a mistake that was made, its impact, and how to prevent it.

### Error Template

```
### 2.X [Brief Error Title]

**What happened**: [Describe the mistake]

**Impact**: [Quantify the damage — e.g., "Precision degraded 4.7×", "Results were unreproducible"]

**Fix**: [What solved it]

**Prevention**: [How to avoid in future scripts — check that goes in pre-flight]

**Learned from**: [Iteration/script where this was discovered]
```

### 2.1 Missing Launch Phase Angle / Rotating Frame Deflection

**What happened**: Assuming a simplified 1D radial launch opposite the Moon ($\phi = 180^\circ$) ignores the rotating nature of the Earth-Moon system in the CR3BP model. Coriolis and centrifugal deflections in the rotating frame bend the spacecraft away from the Moon.

**Impact**: The spacecraft missed the Moon by over 213,000 km, and zero candidate free-return trajectories were found.

**Fix**: Implement a systematic 2D sweep across launch phase angles ($\phi \in [0^\circ, 360^\circ]$) and TLI injection speeds to discover the Coriolis compensation angle ($\phi = 245.0^\circ$).

**Prevention**: Always account for rotating frame accelerations (Coriolis and Centrifugal) when modeling three-body trajectories. Treat launch phase geometry as a primary degree of freedom.

**Learned from**: Iteration 1 / `script_01_trajectory_sweep.py`

### 2.2 SciPy `solve_ivp` Positional Argument Signature Error

**What happened**: Passing initial state using positional argument `y` instead of the keyword/positional `y0` parameter in the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` call.

**Impact**: Executing the simulation crashed immediately with a `TypeError` signature mismatch.

**Fix**: Correct the parameter signature to explicitly target `y0` (e.g., `solve_ivp(fun, t_span, y0, ...)`).

**Prevention**: Use explicit keyword arguments or consult SciPy's current documentation for `solve_ivp`.

**Learned from**: Iteration 1 / `script_01_trajectory_sweep.py`

### 2.3 CMD Pipeline Character Command-Line Crash

**What happened**: Attempting to append console run results to the bottom of the script using terminal operations containing pipe characters (`|`) or complex multiline strings directly on the Windows Command Prompt (CMD).

**Impact**: The command line interpreter interpreted `|` as a standard input redirect, causing a command execution error and failure to write results.

**Fix**: Use a standalone, safe Python script to perform file-write/append operations programmatically rather than relying on raw CMD strings.

**Prevention**: Avoid shell pipe chaining in Windows CMD or complex multi-line command concatenation; delegate file manipulation to Python scripts.

**Learned from**: Iteration 1 / `script_01_trajectory_sweep.py`

### 2.4 Initial Grid Range Mismatch in 2D Parameter Searches

**What happened**: Defining initial search ranges for TLI velocity and launch phase angle based purely on standard elliptical calculations (e.g. searching only below $10.92\text{ km/s}$) can miss the narrow bands where three-body gravity creates direct impacts.

**Impact**: The initial simulation ran with zero impacts found, leading to a temporary dead end.

**Fix**: Set up rapid, low-tolerance coarse exploratory sweeps (such as `search_intercept.py` and `fine_intercept_search.py`) with wide parameter bounds to systematically locate the active parameter bands, and then focus the main high-fidelity script tightly on those bands.

**Prevention**: For highly sensitive three-body transfer trajectories, always prepend high-fidelity searches with a coarse-to-fine multi-grid search to confirm the existence of targets before generating final metrics.

**Learned from**: Iteration 2 / `script_02_lunar_intercept.py`

---

### 2.5 Overly Restrictive Coarse Filtering in Chaotic Boundary Searches

**What happened**: Forcing strict criteria (such as requiring a high minimum loop count of $N_{\text{loops}} \ge 1.5$) in the initial coarse phase of a multi-grid search when investigating highly chaotic boundaries like the Weak Stability Boundary (WSB).

**Impact**: Zero candidates were found in Phase 1, causing the high-fidelity refinement in Phase 2 to fail with a critical execution error, even though a highly active return candidate completing $1.214$ loops was physically present in the sweep.

**Fix**: Loosen the coarse candidate selection filter (e.g. down to $N_{\text{loops}} \ge 1.0$) to let the active boundary basins pass through to Phase 2, and add active tracking diagnostics that print any trajectory achieving moderate loops ($\ge 0.5$ loops) to visualize the boundary's location.

**Prevention**: In highly sensitive chaotic systems where the absolute physical boundaries of passive states are unknown, always implement verbose, permissive diagnostic logging for "near-misses" and set lenient thresholds for coarse passes.

**Learned from**: Iteration 3 / `script_03_multi_loop_return.py`

---

### 2.3 [Example: Evaluation set mismatch]

**What happened**: [e.g., Used wrong dataset's evaluation criteria for scoring]

**Impact**: [e.g., All metrics were meaningless]

**Fix**: [e.g., Parameterize dataset/domain in config, validate against data]

**Prevention**: [e.g., Pre-flight check #3 — verify evaluation set matches data domain]

**Learned from**: [iter_XX / script_XX]

---

### 2.4 [Example: dtype not specified for ID columns]

**What happened**: [e.g., IDs loaded as int instead of string, causing join failures]

**Impact**: [e.g., Silent data loss — 30% of pairs dropped]

**Fix**:
```python
# [Corrected code with dtype='str']
```

**Prevention**: [e.g., Always specify dtype for ID columns]

**Learned from**: [iter_XX / script_XX]

---

### 2.5 [Example: Not deduplicating pairs]

**What happened**: [e.g., (A,B) and (B,A) both present, inflating pair count]

**Impact**: [e.g., Metrics computed on inflated N, overestimating significance]

**Fix**:
```python
# [Canonical ordering + dedup code]
```

**Prevention**: [e.g., Always apply canonical_order() then drop_duplicates()]

**Learned from**: [iter_XX / script_XX]

---

### 2.6 [Example: Inconsistent column names across files]

**What happened**: [e.g., Some files use "item_a/item_b", others "source/target"]

**Impact**: [e.g., Merge failures, silent empty results]

**Fix**: [e.g., Standardize on load with rename mapping]

**Prevention**: [e.g., Standards section 3.1 defines canonical column names]

**Learned from**: [iter_XX / script_XX]

---

### 2.7 [Example: Missing metadata in results]

**What happened**: [e.g., Results saved without recording which benchmark/parameters were used]

**Impact**: [e.g., Cannot reproduce or compare results across iterations]

**Fix**: [e.g., Always save config + metadata alongside results]

**Prevention**: [e.g., Use standard results reporting pattern (Section 1.8)]

**Learned from**: [iter_XX / script_XX]

---

### 2.8 [Example: Hardcoded paths instead of constants]

**What happened**: [e.g., Paths were hardcoded, broke when directory structure changed]

**Impact**: [e.g., Scripts failed silently or read wrong data]

**Fix**: [e.g., Define all paths as constants relative to project root]

**Prevention**: [e.g., Use file organization pattern (Section 1.9)]

**Learned from**: [iter_XX / script_XX]

---
