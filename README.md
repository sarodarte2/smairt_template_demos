**A professional, scientist-friendly set of SMAIRT demos for learning how to do reproducible, AI-assisted research without giving up scientific judgment.**

SMAIRT stands for **Scientific Method with AI Research Template**. These demos are designed to help a scientist, student, reviewer, or curious newcomer understand the framework quickly, pick a domain-specific example, and run an honest first research iteration.

## What SMAIRT is

SMAIRT is a way to use an AI coding assistant like a research collaborator **without letting AI take control of the project as the lead scientist**.

The AI helps you move faster: it can summarize context, draft code, propose experiments, and help keep a clean record. But **you** still decide:

- what question matters
- what assumptions are acceptable
- whether the code is correct
- whether the result is believable
- what the next experiment should be

That combination is the point of the framework: **AI speed with human scientific control**.

---

## Why these demos exist

These demo folders are not just toy scripts. They are meant to show scientists how to:

1. start from a research question
2. create a fresh SMAIRT project
3. prime an AI assistant with the right context
4. run a focused, reviewable experiment
5. interpret the result honestly
6. continue for multiple iterations with a reproducible audit trail

The finished product is not just code. It is a **followable reasoning trail** showing what was asked, what was run, what happened, and what was concluded.

## The SMAIRT Loop

Every SMAIRT project follows the same core loop.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Background] --> B[Hypothesis]
    B --> C[Methods and Code]
    C --> D[Results]
    D --> E[Analysis]
    E --> F[Next Step]
    F --> B
```

### What each step means

- **Background** — what is known, what is being asked, and what assumptions or constraints matter
- **Hypothesis** — a specific, testable claim
- **Methods and Code** — the script, data, model, or query used to test the claim
- **Results** — the raw outputs, figures, logs, tables, or measurements
- **Analysis** — what the result means, what it does **not** mean, and what to do next
- **Next Step** — the updated question for the next iteration

### The four project artifacts SMAIRT tries to preserve

A good SMAIRT iteration produces four concrete pieces of evidence inside the generated project:

1. **Background context**
2. **Hypothesis file**
3. **Experiment script or analysis method**
4. **Results plus interpretation**

That structure is what makes the workflow reproducible, hand-off friendly, and recoverable when an AI session gets lost.

## What AI does vs. what the scientist does

| AI is good at                         | The scientist must still do                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| turning context into draft code       | deciding whether the question is meaningful                |
| proposing a first experiment          | checking assumptions and units                             |
| editing files quickly                 | rejecting bad ideas and narrowing scope                    |
| keeping naming and logging consistent | interpreting whether the result is scientifically credible |
| summarizing logs and prior work       | deciding what the next iteration should be                 |

If the AI is wrong, overconfident, or vague, that is **not** a failure of SMAIRT. Catching that is part of the scientific workflow.

## Demo Track Gallery

The demos below are organized so a scientist can choose an approachable domain and practice the same SMAIRT loop in different styles.

### Core Showcase Tracks

These are the main scientist-facing showcase demos for learning the framework.

## Quick start

### 1. Pick a track

Start with one of the demo folders above, then open that folder's [`DEMO.md`](lunar/DEMO.md).

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Run these commands **from the demo folder you chose**. For example, if you choose the lunar track, run them from [`lunar/`](lunar/DEMO.md).

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If PowerShell blocks activation on Windows, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then try activation again.

### 3. Generate a fresh SMAIRT project

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/biodataganache/smairt-template.git
```

Each track's [`DEMO.md`](lunar/DEMO.md) provides suggested answers for the Cookiecutter prompts.

### 4. Configure Zoo Code

If you are new to the AI workflow, read [`USING_ZOO_CODE.md`](USING_ZOO_CODE.md). For a concrete mental model of how to begin, also read [`FIRST_SCRIPT_GUIDE.md`](FIRST_SCRIPT_GUIDE.md).

Recommended settings:

| Setting      | Value                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Provider | OpenAI Compatible (works with OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, or a local server such as Ollama / LM Studio, or any institutional gateway) |
| API Base URL | Your provider's documented base URL (for example, `https://api.openai.com/v1` for OpenAI) |
| API Key      | A key from your chosen provider                                                        |
| Model        | Choose by track difficulty (see the guidance below)                                    |

#### Choosing a model by difficulty

Match the model to the difficulty of the track you picked:

| Track difficulty             | Suggested model tier                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beginner (Lunar, Enzyme, Peptide) | A fast, lightweight reasoning model. It iterates quickly and costs less. |
| Intermediate (Protein Properties, Differential Abundance, PPI) | A mid-tier model for stronger multi-step reasoning and code quality. |
| Advanced (HVP, Protein LM)   | A larger, stronger reasoning model. Larger models tend to perform better on harder, multi-file, or database-heavy problems. |
| Flexible (Bring Your Own)    | Match the model to your problem's complexity.                            |

Start small and step up to a larger model if the assistant struggles.

### 5. Prime the assistant before asking for code

In your new SMAIRT project, the assistant should read these files first:

1. `prompts/AI_CONTEXT.md`
2. `prompts/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`
3. `background/01_initial_question.md`

That keeps the interaction anchored to the framework rather than drifting into generic code generation. If you are unsure what to ask for first, use [`FIRST_SCRIPT_GUIDE.md`](FIRST_SCRIPT_GUIDE.md) to keep iteration 1 small, checkable, and scientifically useful.

## What a finished demo should look like

A representable SMAIRT demo should leave behind a breadcrumb trail that a scientist or reviewer can follow:

- a clear background question
- one or more numbered hypotheses
- numbered experiment scripts
- auto-captured logs in `results/logs/`
- analysis files explaining what happened
- a record of the human judgment calls that mattered

The completed lunar example shows what a multi-iteration trail can look like, but the goal of this repo is to make **all major showcase tracks** feel equally approachable and followable over 3 to 5 iterations.

## FAQ for non-experts

### Do I need to already know the domain science?

No. The demos are designed to make the workflow understandable even if you are learning the domain as you go. You do, however, need to review whether the AI's assumptions and outputs make sense.

### Do I need to trust the AI?

No. You need to **review** the AI. SMAIRT assumes the assistant will sometimes be wrong, shallow, or overconfident.

### What if the AI gets stuck or loses context?

Start a fresh task, re-attach the project context files, and continue from the files already on disk. SMAIRT is designed to recover from session failure because the project files hold the state.

### Are these demos solutions?

No. Most folders are starting points and walkthroughs, not completed answers. The objective is to show how a scientist can build the answer through iterative, reviewable work.

### Why so much emphasis on synthetic data first?

Because synthetic data gives you a known answer. If your method cannot recover a planted signal in a controlled setting, you should not trust it on real data yet.

---

## Important notes

- Review AI-generated code before running it.
- Keep requests small and specific.
- Record interpretation, not just output.
- Be honest about model limits and data caveats.
- Treat these demos as scaffolds for scientific reasoning, not autonomous pipelines.

SMAIRT works best when the repo teaches both **how to run the framework** and **how to think inside it**.
